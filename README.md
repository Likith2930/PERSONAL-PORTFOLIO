A personal portfolio webpage is a digital showcase of an individual's skills, work, and achievements. It typically includes sections like an introduction, resume, project gallery, contact information, and sometimes a blog. Designed to reflect personal branding, it helps professionals—especially in creative and tech fields—demonstrate their expertise and attract potential clients, employers, or collaborators.
